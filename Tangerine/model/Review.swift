//  REVIEW
//  This file contains several structures, all relating to the idea of a user reviewing another user's Question and giving them feedback
//  The isAReview protocol enabled us to treat AskReviews and Compare reviews interchangeably in many situations.
//  AskReview and CompareReview are so similar, it could be tempting to merge them into one object type "Review." Thus far they have been kept separate for 2 reasons:
//      1. So that the .yes/.no selection and the .top/.bottom selection can be separate which makes the code more readable than TRUE or FALSE which has to be interpreted.
//      2. So that we can add additional features to these review types. Strong Yes/No is a possible example since in a CompareReview we are rating 2 photos. Are they both Strong or only one of them?
// Report is fairly self explanatory and still needs to be full implemented.
// ReviewID is a Tuple for keeping track of specific reviews.

import Foundation
import UIKit

// During normal app operation this is not used. Only on deleting a Questions should its reviews be entered into the reviewArchives table
// The reason for this is to store potentially useful data for follow on monetization.
var reviewArchivesArray: [isAReview] = [] // Nothing done with this thus far....

/// a "Review" is a protocol that governs AskReview's and CompareReview's
